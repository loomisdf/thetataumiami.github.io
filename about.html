      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>
        Since our certification in January 2013, the Miami University Colony of &Theta;&Tau; has grown to 57 members. We have dedicated ourselves
        to the service of the College of Engineering and Computing as well as the greater Oxford community. We have participated in service
        events with national charities such as Habitat for Humanity, Feed My Starving Children, and Relay for Life, as well as local organizations
        such as an animal shelter and the Cincinnati Reds. We have worked with the College of Engineering and Computing on events such as 
        Engineers' Week, Make It Miami tours, and led tutoring sessions for engineering students in any classes.
